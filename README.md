Categorical Feature Encoding
This is such a common task and important skill to master, we've put together a dataset that contains only categorical features, and includes:
binary features
low- and high-cardinality nominal features
low- and high-cardinality ordinal features
(potentially) cyclical features
This competition offers continue to build your skills with the common machine learning task of encoding categorical variables. This challenge adds the additional complexity of feature interactions, as well as missing data.
